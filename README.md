# Custom Image Classifier
Huge part of this is actually <b>help</b> from: 
[pyimagesearch.com](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/).

I just redone and reorganized the code for my own uses and preferences.

Will probably be working more on this in the future. 
Neural networks used in the custom-training-version and the pre-trained-version are:
1. VGGNet 16
1. VGGNet 19
1. ResNet
1. Google Inception
1. Xception

## Requirements
Specified in the <b>requirements.txt</b> file in a table-like format (from PyCharm project preferences).

Note: Using a specific TensorFlow 1.12 .whl file for my own architecture.
