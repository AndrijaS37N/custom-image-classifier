# custom-image-classifier
Topics not managed yet.

Huge part of this is actually <b>help</b> from: 
[pyimagesearch.com](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/)

I will probably be working more on this. 
Neural networks used in the custom-training-version and pre-trained-version are:
* VGGNet 16
* VGGNet 19
* ResNet
* Google Inception
* Xception

Note: Using a specific TensorFlow 1.12 .whl file for my own architecture. 

<i>~ More <b>references</b>, <b>requirements</b> and <b>explanations</b> will be posted soon!</i>
